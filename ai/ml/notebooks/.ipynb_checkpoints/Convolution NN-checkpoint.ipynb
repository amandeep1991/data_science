    "Convolutional networks are a class of neural network that use convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers. On a fully connected layer, all the output units have weights connecting to all the input units. On a convolutional layer, we have some weights that are repeated over the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of convolutional layers over fully connected layers is that the number of parameters is far smaller. This results in better generalization of the model. For example, if we want to learn a transformation from a 10x10 image to another 10x10 image, we will need 10,000 parameters if using a fully connected layer. If we use two convolutional layers, the first one having nine filters and the second one having one filter, with a kernel size of 3x3, we will have only 90 parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional networks are applied where data has a clear dimensionality structure. Time series analysis is an example where one-dimensional convolutions are used; for images, 2D convolutions are used; and for volumetric data, 3D convolutions are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision has been dominated by convolutional networks since 2012 when AlexNet won the ImageNet challenge."
