    "\n",
    "is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases the into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards\n",
    "\n",
    "data shards can be distributed across a number of much less expensive commodity servers. Data shards have comparatively little restriction as far as hardware and software requirements are concerned.\n",

    "In some cases, database sharding can be done fairly simply. One common example is splitting a customer database geographically.\n",

    "Data sharding can be a more complex process in some scenarios, however. Sharding a database that holds less structured data, for example, can be very complicated, and the resulting shards may be difficult to maintain."
