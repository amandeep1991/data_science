    "Most classifiers produce a score, which is then thresholded to decide the classification. If a classifier produces a score between 0.0 (definitely negative) and 1.0 (definitely positive), it is common to consider anything over 0.5 as positive.\n",
    "However, any threshold applied to a dataset (in which PP is the positive population and NP is the negative population) is going to produce true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) (Figure 1). We need a method which will take into account all of these numbers.\n",

    "Once you have numbers for all of these measures, some useful metrics can be calculated.\n",
