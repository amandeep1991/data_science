    "Regularization is any technique that aims to improve the validation score, sometimes at the cost of reducing the training score.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another technique (in addition to cross-validation) that can help solve the issue of model overfitting. Most of the datasets have a pattern and some noise. The goal of the regularization is to reduce the influence of the noise on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some regularization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. L1 regularization (or Lasso regularization):\n",
    "            will select some features to shrink to zero, such that they will not play any role in the final model. \n",
    "            L1 can be seen as a method to select important features.\n",
    "            tries to minimize the absolute value of the parameters of the model. It produces sparse parameters.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "    2. L2 regularization (or Tikhonov regularization):\n",
    "            tries to minimize the square value of the parameters of the model. It produces parameters with small values.\n",
    "            will force all features to be relatively small, such that they will provide less influence on the model.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    3. Dropout is a technique applied to neural networks that randomly sets some of the neuronsâ€™ outputs to zero during training. This forces the network to learn better representations of the data by preventing complex interactions between the neurons: Each neuron needs to learn useful features.\n",
    "    4. Early stopping will stop training when the validation score stops improving, even when the training score may be improving. This prevents overfitting on the training dataset."
