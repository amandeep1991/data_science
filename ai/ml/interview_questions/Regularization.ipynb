    "Some regularization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. L1 tries to minimize the absolute value of the parameters of the model. It produces sparse parameters.\n",
    "    2. L2 tries to minimize the square value of the parameters of the model. It produces parameters with small values.\n",
    "    3. Dropout is a technique applied to neural networks that randomly sets some of the neuronsâ€™ outputs to zero during training. This forces the network to learn better representations of the data by preventing complex interactions between the neurons: Each neuron needs to learn useful features.\n",
    "    4. Early stopping will stop training when the validation score stops improving, even when the training score may be improving. This prevents overfitting on the training dataset."
