    "The success of deep learning in the past decade can be explained by three main factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. More data: The availability of massive labeled datasets allows us to train models with more parameters and achieve state-of-the-art scores. Other ML algorithms do not scale as well as deep learning when it comes to dataset size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. GPU: Training models on a GPU can reduce the training time by orders of magnitude compared to training on a CPU. Currently, cutting-edge models are trained on multiple GPUs or even on specialized hardware.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Improvements in algorithms: ReLU activation, dropout, and complex network architectures have also been very significant factors."
