    "An imbalanced dataset is one that has different proportions of target categories. For example, a dataset with medical images where we have to detect some illness will typically have many more negative samples than positive samples—say, 98% of images are without the illness and 2% of images are with the illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different options to deal with imbalanced datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Oversampling or undersampling: Instead of sampling with a uniform distribution from the training dataset, we can use other distributions so the model sees a more balanced dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Data augmentation: We can add data in the less frequent categories by modifying existing data in a controlled way. In the example dataset, we could flip the images with illnesses, or add noise to copies of the images in such a way that the illness remains visible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Using appropriate metrics: In the example dataset, if we had a model that always made negative predictions, it would achieve a precision of 98%. There are other metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score that describe the accuracy of the model better when using an imbalanced dataset."
