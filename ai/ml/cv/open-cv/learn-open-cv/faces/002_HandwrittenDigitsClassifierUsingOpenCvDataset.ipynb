    "\n",
    "Aligning digits before building a classifier similarly produces superior results. In the case of faces, aligment is rather obvious — you can apply a similarity transformation to an image of a face to align the two corners of the eyes to the two corners of a reference face.\n",

    "In the case of handwritten digits, an obvious variation in writing among people is the slant of their writing. Some writers have a right or forward slant where the digits are slanted forward, some have a backward or left slant, and some have no slant at all. We can help the algorithm quite a bit by fixing this vertical slant so it does not have to learn this variation of the digits. The image on the left shows the original digit in the first column and it’s deskewed (fixed) version.\n",

    "This deskewing of simple grayscale images can be achieved using image moments (an image moment is a certain particular weighted average (moment) of the image pixels' intensities, or a function of such moments, usually chosen to have some attractive property or interpretation.) - [Raw Moments, Central Moments, Moment Invariants]. \n",
