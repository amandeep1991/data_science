# What is machine learning
    * next natural step of AI - processing, understanding data and reacting intelligence
    * applied statistics - evaluate, summarize data using advance formulaes
    * advanced algorithms - operate on input and provide some output
So to recapitulate  it is the next evolution step for a lot of things

# How machine learning different from traditional programming?
    * Traditionally we built the decision making directly into the program.
        * So if we want to write traditional program to detect a human face, we would write look the eyes, eye-brows, nose, mouth etc.
    * With machine learning, we would write any of such thing in the program. We would build an agent which would look at a set of images at a time and figure out whose face that might be.
        * why now - computers are more relied now a days and a lot of data is getting generated so is at our service to make risk-free strategies to increase the profit.

# Applications:-
    * Machine learning can be applied to nearly all the domains.
    * To exemplify - Electronic Trading, disease diagnosis,
