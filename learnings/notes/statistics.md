# TRIAL AND EVENT
> events
>>1.  elementary event 
>>2.  compound event
>>3.  EXHAUSTIVE EVENTS
>>4.  FAVOURABLE EVENTS
>>5.  MUTALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS (if two or more of them cannot happen simultaneously in the same trial)
>>>*  In throwing of a die all the 6 faces numbered q to 6 are mutually exclusive since if any one these faces comes up, the possibilities of others in the same trial, is ruled out.
>>6.  EQUALLY LIKELY EVENTS
>>7.  INDEPENDENT EVENTS
>>>* If P(B|A)=P(B) and P(A|B)=P(A) the A and B are independent events.
>>>* P(A∩B)=P(A)P(B)
>>8.  MATHEMATICAL OR CLASSICAL PROBABILITY
>>9.  THE AXIOMS OF PROBABILITY
>>10. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY 
>>>*  P(A∩B)=P(B)*P(B|A)
>>>*  P(B|A)=P(A∩B)/P(A) if P(A)!=0
>>>*  P(B|A)=(P(B|A)*P(A))/P(A)
>>>*  P(A∩B∩C)=P(A)*P(B/A)*P(C/A∩B)   for 3 events 
>>11. When ratio is given (3:4:5) then probability would be 3/12, 4/12, 5/12  
>>12. When ratio is given (3:4:5) then probability would be 3/12, 4/12, 5/12  
>>13. Total Probability Rule:
>>>* P(B) = P(B∩A)+P(B∩A') = P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|A')*P(A') 
>>14. Variance for random variable:
>>>* Var(X) = sigma-square = E(X-ǖ) ** 2 = E(X**2) - [E(x)]**2
