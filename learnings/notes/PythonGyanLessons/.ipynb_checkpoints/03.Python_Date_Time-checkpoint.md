# Things to be covered:
>* Date, Time & Date Time classes provides a number of functions to deal with dates ,times & time interval.
>* Date Time classes in Python are categorized into five main classes:
>>1. Time : Time independent of the day (Hour,minute, second,microsecond)
>>2. Datetime : Combination of time & date ( Month, day , hour, second, microsecond)
>>3. Timedelta : a duration of time used for manipulating dates.
>>4. Tzinfo : An abstract class for dealing with time zones.

# Time Class
>* The beginning of time is started measuring from 1 January, 12:00 am, 1970 and this very time is termed as **“epoch”** in Python.

```python
import time

# using time() to display time since epoch
print("Seconds elapsed since the epoch are:",time.time())

# Converts seconds into different time details as key value pair.
now = time.localtime(time.time())


# using gmtime() to return the time attribute structure
# Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing UTC (a.k.a. GMT). When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.
print("Time calculated acc. to given seconds is:", time.gmtime()) # Current Time
print("Time calculated acc. to given seconds is:", time.gmtime(1539500000)) # passed seconds since epoch
```

>* Few important functions
>>* **time**: 
>>>* It measures the number of seconds since the epoch as a floating point value.
>>>* Used to measure the time elapsed.

```python
import time
print(time.time()) #returns seconds

start = time.time()
print("I'm doing a job.")
time.sleep(2) #seconds
end = time.time()
time_lapsed_in_seconds = end - start
print('Total Execution Time:', time_lapsed_in_seconds)
```


>* **clock**: 
>>* Unlike the time.time() function which computes the wall clock time, the time.clock() returns the processor clock time.
>>* We can use time.clock() for performance testing/benchmarking and time.time() to schedule something.

```python
import time
time.clock()
```

>* **sleep**: 
>>* halts the execution of the current thread for the specified number of seconds.

```python
import time
secondsInFloat = 10.0
time.sleep(secondsInFloat)
```


>* **strftime**: 
>>* formats date in the given format

```python
import time

now = time.localtime(time.time())

print(time.asctime(now))
print(time.strftime("%y/%m/%d %H:%M", now))
print(time.strftime("%a %b %d", now))
print(time.strftime("%c", now))
print(time.strftime("%I %p", now))
print(time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z", now))
```
