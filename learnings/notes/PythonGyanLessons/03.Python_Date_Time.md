# Things to be covered:
>* Date, Time & Date Time classes provides a number of functions to deal with dates ,times & time interval.
>* Date Time classes in Python are categorized into five main classes:
>>1. Time : Time independent of the day (Hour,minute, second,microsecond)
>>2. Datetime : Combination of time & date ( Month, day , hour, second, microsecond)
>>3. Timedelta : a duration of time used for manipulating dates.
>>4. Tzinfo : An abstract class for dealing with time zones.

# Time Module
>* The beginning of time is started measuring from 1 January, 12:00 am, 1970 and this very time is termed as **“epoch”** in Python.

```python
import time

#COMMENT using time() to display time since epoch
print("Seconds elapsed since the epoch are:",time.time())
# Seconds elapsed since the epoch are: 1539957935.6607878

# Converts seconds into different time details as key value pair.
now = time.localtime(time.time())


#COMMENT using gmtime() to return the time attribute structure
#COMMENT Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing UTC (a.k.a. GMT). When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.

print("Time calculated acc. to given seconds is:", time.gmtime()) # Current Time
# Time calculated acc. to given seconds is: time.struct_time(tm_year=2018, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=19, tm_hour=14, tm_min=5, tm_sec=47, tm_wday=4, tm_yday=292, tm_isdst=0)

print("Time calculated acc. to given seconds is:", time.gmtime(1539500000)) # passed seconds since epoch
# Time calculated acc. to given seconds is: time.struct_time(tm_year=2018, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=14, tm_hour=6, tm_min=53, tm_sec=20, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=287, tm_isdst=0)
```

>* Few important functions
>>* **time**: 
>>>* It measures the number of seconds since the epoch as a floating point value.
>>>* Used to measure the time elapsed.

```python
import time
print(time.time()) #returns seconds
# 1539957978.0080307

start = time.time()
print("I'm doing a job.")
time.sleep(2) #seconds
end = time.time()
time_lapsed_in_seconds = end - start
print('Total Execution Time:', time_lapsed_in_seconds)
# I'm doing a job.
# Total Execution Time: 2.0006930828094482
```


>* **perf_counter**:
>>* Unlike the time.time() function which computes the wall clock time, the time.clock() returns the processor clock time.
>>* We can use time.perf_counter() for performance testing/benchmarking and time.time() to schedule something.

```python
import time
time.perf_counter()
# 41328.394995109
time.process_time()
# 25.96875
```

>* **sleep**: 
>>* halts the execution of the current thread for the specified number of seconds.

```python
import time
secondsInFloat = 10.0
time.sleep(secondsInFloat)
```


>* **strftime**: 
>>* formats date in the given format

```python
import time

now = time.localtime(time.time())

print(time.asctime(now))
print(time.strftime("%y/%m/%d %H:%M", now))
print(time.strftime("%a %b %d", now))
print(time.strftime("%c", now))
print(time.strftime("%I %p", now))
print(time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z", now))

# timedelta
>* A timedelta object represents a duration, the difference between two dates or times. [seconds in a day = 86400]

```python
from datetime import timedelta
d1 = timedelta(seconds=10)
d2 = timedelta(microseconds=1)
print((d1.days, d1.seconds, d1.microseconds))
# (0, 10, 0)
d1 = d1-d2
print((d1.days, d1.seconds, d1.microseconds))
# (0, 9, 999999)

d1 = timedelta(seconds=-10)
print((d1.days, d1.seconds, d1.microseconds))
# (-1, 86390, 0)
d1=abs(d1)
print((d1.days, d1.seconds, d1.microseconds))
# (0, 10, 0)

print(str(d1)) # '-1 day, 23:59:59.999999' or  '0:00:00.000001'
# 0:00:10

print(d1.total_seconds()) # contains total number of seconds contained in the duration
# 10.0
```

>* Only 3 attributes (for retrieval):
>>1. days
>>2. seconds
>>3. microseconds
	
>* Only 7 parameters (for construction):
>>1. days
>>2. seconds
>>3. microseconds
>>4. milliseconds
>>5. minutes
>>6. hours
>>7. weeks

>* Different operations supported (between 2 timedelta)
>>* Addition, subtraction, divide, multiplication, modulus, divmod (multiplication not supported).

>* Different operations supported (with scaler)
>>* multiplication, divide, // (Addition, subtraction, modulus not supported).



# tzinfo
>* A naive datetime object contains no timezone information. The easiest way to tell if a datetime object is naive is by checking tzinfo. tzinfo will be set to None of the object is naive.

```python
import datetime

naive = datetime.datetime.now()
print(naive.tzinfo)
# None
```
	
>* To make a datetime object offset aware, you can use the pytz library. First, you have to instantiate a timezone object, and then use that timezone object to "localize" a datetime object. Localizing simply gives the object timezone information.

```python
import datetime
import pytz

d = datetime.datetime.now()
timezone = pytz.timezone("Asia/Kolkata") # timezone = pytz.timezone("America/Los_Angeles")
d_aware = timezone.localize(d)
print(d_aware.tzinfo)
# Asia/Kolkata
```

>* A naive datetime object is limited in that it cannot locate itself in relation to offset aware datetime objects.

```python
import datetime
import pytz

d_naive = datetime.datetime.now()
timezone = pytz.timezone("Asia/Kolkata")
d_aware = timezone.localize(d_naive)
#ERROR TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
#ERROR d_naive < d_aware
```

>* Once you're familiar with aware datetime objects, timezone conversions are relatively easy. Let's create a datetime object with a UTC timezone, and convert it to Pacific Standard.

```python
import datetime
import pytz

utc_now = pytz.utc.localize(datetime.datetime.utcnow())
print(utc_now)
# 2018-10-19 14:16:33.163281+00:00
pst_now = utc_now.astimezone(pytz.timezone("America/Los_Angeles"))
print(pst_now)
# 2018-10-19 07:16:33.163281-07:00

print(pst_now == utc_now)
# True
```


# Why datetime when there was already time module?
>* the time module is principally for working with unix time stamps; expressed as a floating point number taken to be seconds since the unix epoch. 
>* The datetime module can support many of the same operations, but provides a more object oriented set of types, and also has some limited support for time zones.
