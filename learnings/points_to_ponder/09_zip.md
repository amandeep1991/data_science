######1. What is your role in Infogain?
######2. What all information can capture using Graph API on Facebook?
######3. Did you also check data is normalized or not? Or what percentage of data is missing in your data?
######4. What if for some of the variable 40% of data is missing? In that case how you would be handling this data? 
######5. Data Augmentation
######6. Few users have installed my application and I just have only latest data. But for older users, I may have more data (all features must have been received). So in that case I would be having a sparse information. From sms I am getting informations like check bounce, emi transactions, credit history etc. For few users I have 6 months data and few others I have 4 months data and for huge number of customers I have data for just 1 month or 2 weeks. So now I have to use this data to create the score card of each data. (different model for each users? yes). I don't have demographic information (as our source of info is message). What would be my approach to augment values in data having null values. (impute is not the choice - u are replacing nothing with something and this doesn't ensure that the something value actually depicts my actual user or not)
######7. How can I use categorical variable in logestic regression problem (few boolean & few categorical variables)
######8. Problem when changing categories by rank. Numerical value would mean something in place of categorical variable. (Linear regression 2 points would be in the same axis ordered which is not good or practically right)
######9. Scaler value into vector in numpy (why I need to convert to vector matrix is important -  concurrent operations of matrix multiplication)
#####10. Why numpy arrays are faster than numpy arrays (Answer: Also, many Numpy operations are implemented in C, avoiding the general cost of loops in Python, pointer indirection and per-element dynamic type checking. The speed boost depends on which operations you're performing, but a few orders of magnitude isn't uncommon in number crunching programs.)
#####11. What is the use of constructor or destructor in python
