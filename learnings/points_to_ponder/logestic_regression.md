>* Advantages of WoE:
>>1. Handles missing values
>>2. Handles outliers
>>3. The transformation is based on **logarithmic value of distributions**. This is aligned with the logistic regression output function
>>4. No need for dummy variables
>>5. By using proper binning technique, it can establish monotonic relationship (either increase or decrease) between the independent and dependent variable
