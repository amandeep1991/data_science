## Hold-Out sets:
>* The hold-out set is similar to unknown data, because the model has not "seen" it before.
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

X,y = np.array([]),np.array([])
model = LinearRegression()

# split the data with 50% in each set
X1, X2, y1, y2 = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0,
                                  train_size=0.5)

# fit the model on one set of data
model.fit(X1, y1)

# evaluate the model on the second set of data
y2_model = model.predict(X2)
accuracy_score(y2, y2_model)
```

## Cross-validation
>* Hold-out has disadvantage that we have lost a portion of our data to the model training.
>>* This is not optimal, and can cause problems â€“ especially if the initial set of training data is small.
>* **Cross-Validation** is to do a sequence of fits where each subset of the data is used both as a training set and as a validation set.
