1. Few Questions:
	a. What type of model you used here - regression or classification:
	b. Assumptions of linear regression model
		i. Answer: Muummm...
		ii. Have you heard about Multicolinearity, hetroscadicity or autocorrelation.
		iii. Ways of removing multicolinearity ?
			1) Answer: PCA (we have to find all those features keeping as much variance as we can to avoid any biasness) 
		iv. Have you heard about correlation or eigen values?
			1) Answer: Eigen values used in PCA, correlation is between 2 variables
		v. What is hetroscadicity and autocorrelation?
		vi. How did you evaluate the model whether it is doing good or not?
			1) Answer: We have created a model and delta on average was 200 GB and on production fluctuating from 300GBP to 400GBP
		vii. What is the difference between R-square and Adjusted R-square
			1) Answer: Mummh
		viii. You wrote like 7 class classification models: (yaha toh awaj hi badal gayi thi meri)
			1) Which tool you have used - Python?
				a) Can we run multiclass in python, which python class?
				b) How did you determine the accuracy of the model
				c) Have you heard about confusion matrix
					i) Answer: Four output
				d) In this class, 7 class classification model, what would be the size of confusion matrix?
					i) Answer: earlier i said 2*7  and then 7*7
				e) Did you check ROC value also.
		ix. How good are you in python?
			1) which packages you are aware about - numpy, pandas, sckit learn
			2) numpy and pandas - which would be faster
				a) Answer - Numpy (homogeneous types) and it is faster unlike pandas
			3) How to join two pandas dataframe.
				a) Column-wise
				b) Row-wise
			4) Different between iloc and loc
			
		x. You have also mentioned that you know NLP
