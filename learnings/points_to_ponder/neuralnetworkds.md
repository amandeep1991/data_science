## Basic understanding:
>1. A nice way to think about neural networks is dividing the NN into two parts, the representation part, and the classification/regression part.

>2. The first part (on the left) is trying to learn a good representation of the data that will help the second part (on the right) to perform a linear classification/regression. You can read more about that idea in this great post.
